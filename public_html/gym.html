            <p>Your tutorial invites more questions for clarity.. viewport is necessary and many other issues for elements like photo images need to be scalable when browser adjusted by width and height, and also if orientation for portrait or landscape is detected either above or below a specific width or height then mobile responsive sites will react to that using proper data input too.  Max-width: 100%   for IMG is that all which will help all artwork or img's scale properly with browser manual adjustment?  What about multiple style sheets so all desktop viewers view with their browser your website is still shows the same and so the website doesnt use the mobile device stylesheet default in every case. How is this prevented?﻿</p>
